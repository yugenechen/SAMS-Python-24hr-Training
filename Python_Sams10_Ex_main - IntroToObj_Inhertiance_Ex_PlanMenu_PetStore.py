#  SAMS Python Chapter 10 Quiz and Excercise
#  Making Objects, pp 102 - 112
# Questions (p 111):

# 1) What is the difference between an objects attributes and its methods?
#   [Answer]:  An attribute is a property or data value.  A method is a function.
#              example, student.age would contain the age value of the student.
#                       student.getAge() may be a method implemented to
#                         calculate the age based on the birth year and current
#                         year.
#                       student.putAge() may be a method implemented to overwrite
#                         the calculated age with a user entered age.

# 2) What is an instance?
#   [Answer]:  an instance is an instance of a data type object.  It exists
#              for the program and can be changed but changing attribute values
#              only affects the instance and not all objects built from the class.
#              Other than inheriting the parent class structure, default
#              attributes and methods it is independent from all other objects
#              of the same class.

# 3) Why should you learn how to use objects?
#   [Answer]: Objects are an easy way to group related data and related methods,
#             mimic real world objects, and convey information (data with syntax)
#             to others.
#             Book's answer:  Objects can hlep make your code easier to manage
#                             by bundling together values and functions.

#1) You've been asked to plan out the objects for a pet store.  Think of the
#   things a pet sotre might have, what functions you might want to attach to
#   them, and what attributes they migh have.  Don't forget to use inheritance
#   to make your life a bit easier.
#
#   Some examples of things that might be in the store (to get you started):
#   a.  Different kinds of animals
#   b.  Pet food
#   c.  Toys
#   d.  Books on pets


def main():
    class myPetStore:
            item.group
            item.group.Name
            Item.Description
            Item.Price
        
        pet.pettype.Name = "kind of animal"
        pet.petType.description
        pet.petType.Price = "1.00"

        methods:
            a) setPrice = float
            b) numInStock = integer
            c) setDescription = string
            d) setName = string ; used for type, product name
            e) setDiscount = float
            f) getDiscount = float ; %
        
        PetFood.name = 'pet food name'
        PetFood.name.description
        PetFood.name.price
